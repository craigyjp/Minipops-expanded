# Minipops-expanded

The Wee 03 has some extra features over the standard Arduino Nano based minipops, it has a pitch feature to change the sample playback speed (also affects the tempo). And it has some sync options for korg little bits etc. I added a 16-1 mux to show the beat and pattern selected. I also fixed the issue with the 12 beat rhythms showing one beat out of sync.
